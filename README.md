## What is Datathon  
Just like Hackathon, datathon aims to test students' ability to find and solve problems based on the given data and task in a limited time. The time limitation here is **24** hours. All groups have **15** minutes to present their works to the judges who are senior Ph.D. students or professionals in their industries, especially in data analysis.   
## Data source  
[CFPB Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database#topic=consumer_navigation)  
## Problem Statement  
> Using the above data source and any others from your own research, create analytics and make conclusions so that you can advise cfpb on its future plans, actions, and legislation proposals so that this market becomes more efficient and the number of consumer complaints decreases.  

> Specifically, identify the products, sub-products, issues and sub issues as well as corporations and sub sectors that create most problems for the consumers.  Search through the consumer text narratives to identify the top areas of consumer complaints.   

> Identify all possible factors, existing in this dataset or not, that have the highest impact in leading to consumer complaints.  Provide advice to the federal government and propose five specific pieces of legislation to the US Congress.
